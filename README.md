## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Database Creation and Data Import
The foundation of any data analysis is a robust database. I began by creating a new database named "Capstone" using SQL:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Capstone;
```

This step is crucial as it establishes a dedicated environment for the dataset, preventing conflicts with other data and enabling efficient querying. Importance: A well-structured database ensures data security, scalability, and easy collaborationâ€”essential for enterprise-level analytics.

Next, I imported four key tables from an Excel file ("Superstore Analysis.xlsx") into the database using SQL Server Management Studio. The tables were:

- **Orders**: Contains transaction details like Order ID, Dates, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Product ID, Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit.
- **Customer**: Includes Customer ID, Name, and Segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
- **Product**: Details Product ID, Category (e.g., Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology), Sub-Category, and Name.
- **Region** (labeled as "Country" in the file but functionally regional): Covers geographic data like City, State, Postal Code, and Region (e.g., West, South).

Importing tables individually allowed for verification of data types and integrity (e.g., ensuring dates were formatted correctly and no duplicates existed). Importance: Clean data import reduces errors in downstream analysis, saving time and ensuring reliable insights. The dataset comprised over 5,000 orders, 793 customers, 1,862 products, and geographic details across the U.S.

### 2. Executing SQL Queries
With the database set up, I addressed 10 specific SQL queries to explore the data. Each query built on the last, progressing from basic retrieval to complex joins. Here's a breakdown, including the query code, purpose, and importance:

1. **Display Individual Tables**  
   ```sql
   SELECT TABLE_NAME
   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
   WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE'
   ORDER BY TABLE_NAME;
   ```  
   Purpose: Lists all tables (Orders, Customer, Product, Region).  
   Importance: Verifies database structure, ensuring all data is accessible a critical first step in exploratory data analysis (EDA) to avoid missing components.

2. **List All Customers with ID, Name, and Segment**  
   ```sql
   SELECT [Customer_ID], [Customer_Name], [Segment]
   FROM [dbo].[Customer];
   ```  
   Purpose: Retrieves customer demographics.  
   Importance: Segments customers (e.g., 50% Consumer) for targeted marketing; understanding the customer base is key to personalization strategies.

3. **List Product Name, ID, Category, and Sub-Category**  
   ```sql
   SELECT [Product_Name], [Product_ID], [Category], [Sub_Category]
   FROM [dbo].[Product];
   ```  
   Purpose: Catalogs products.  
   Importance: Enables product performance analysis; categorizing helps identify trends, like Technology driving higher margins.

4. **Display All Columns for Products in 'Furniture' Category**  
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM [dbo].[Product]
   WHERE [Category] = 'Furniture';
   ```  
   Purpose: Filters for Furniture items.  
   Importance: Category-specific queries reveal underperformers (e.g., Furniture had lower profits due to discounts), guiding inventory decisions.

5. **Products with Name Starting with 'Boston'**  
   ```sql
   SELECT [Product_Name], [Product_ID]
   FROM [dbo].[Product]
   WHERE [Product_Name] LIKE 'Boston%';
   ```  
   Purpose: Pattern matching for specific products.  
   Importance: Useful for targeted searches, like branding or stock checks; demonstrates string functions for real-world data cleaning.

6. **Products with Name Containing 'Collection'**  
   ```sql
   SELECT [Product_Name], [Product_ID]
   FROM [dbo].[Product]
   WHERE [Product_Name] LIKE '%Collection%';
   ```  
   Purpose: Identifies themed products.  
   Importance: Highlights product lines for bundling opportunities, enhancing cross-selling.

7. **Orders Made in March 2014**  
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM [dbo].[Order]
   WHERE [Order_Date] LIKE '2014-03-%';
   ```  
   Purpose: Time-based filtering.  
   Importance: Analyzes seasonal trends; March data showed steady sales, informing promotional timing.

8. **Orders Not Made in March 2014 but Shipped Between March 5-30, 2014**  
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM [dbo].[Order]
   WHERE [Order_Date] NOT LIKE '2014-03-%'
   AND ([Ship_Date] >= '2014-03-05' AND [Ship_Date] <= '2014-03-30');
   ```  
   Purpose: Complex date conditions.  
   Importance: Uncovers fulfillment delays; critical for logistics optimization, as delays impact customer satisfaction.

9. **Join Orders to Customers on Customer ID**  
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM [dbo].[Order]
   JOIN [dbo].[Customer] ON [dbo].[Order].[Customer_ID] = [dbo].[Customer].[Customer_ID];
   ```  
   Purpose: Combines transaction and customer data.  
   Importance: Enables customer-level analysis (e.g., repeat buyers like Sean Miller); joins are foundational for relational insights.

10. **Multi-Table Join: Orders, Customers, Products, Regions**  
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM [dbo].[Order]
    JOIN [dbo].[Customer] ON [dbo].[Order].[Customer_ID] = [dbo].[Customer].[Customer_ID]
    JOIN [dbo].[Product] ON [dbo].[Order].[Product_ID] = [dbo].[Product].[Product_ID]
    JOIN [dbo].[Region] ON [dbo].[Order].[Postal_Code] = [dbo].[Region].[Postal_Code];
    ```  
    Purpose: Integrates all data for holistic views.  
    Importance: Creates a unified dataset for advanced analytics; essential for cross-functional reports like regional sales by category.

These queries were executed in SQL Server, with results exported for verification. Importance overall: SQL proficiency ensures efficient data extraction, reducing reliance on manual processes and enabling scalable analysis.
